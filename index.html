        <p>
          A <strong>markup language</strong> is a computer language that uses
          tags to define elements within a document. Markup languages are used
          to annotate a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable
          from the text, and can assign semantic meaning to the text.
        </p>

        <p>
          Types of markup languages - Presentational markup - used by
          traditional word-processing systems, implemented as binary codes
          embedded within document text (e.g. Microsoft Word). - Procedural
          markup - markup is embedded in text, which then provides instructions
          for programs to process the text (e.g. TeX). - Descriptive (logical)
          markup - markup is used to label parts of the document rather than to
          provide specific instructions as to how they should be processed (e.g.
          HTML).

        <h2>1.2. HTML</h2>

        <p>
          HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for
          documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
        </p>

        <p class="heading">
          HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap,
          or mark up different parts of the content to make it appear or act a
          certain way.
        </p>

        <h3>1.2.1. How the browser displays HTML</h3>

        1. The browser parses the HTML to construct the DOM tree. 2. The DOM
        tree is used to construct a render tree. 3. A layout is generated from
        the render tree. 4. The render three is painted to the screen according
        to the generated layout.
